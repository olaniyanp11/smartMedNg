# 🏥 SmartMed NG  
### **AI-Powered Student Health Portal Built on Nigerian Domain Infrastructure**

SmartMed NG is a secure, AI-driven student health portal designed for Nigerian university medical centres. The platform integrates **AI triage**, **functional React frontend**, **local .ng domain infrastructure**, and a future-ready backend design aimed at strengthening data sovereignty in Nigerian educational institutions.

This project was developed for the **NKF NIRA-XT Hackathon II**, aligning with the theme of **Registry Efficiency, Cybersecurity, and Digital Trust**.

# 📌 1. Problem Statement

Most university medical centres in Nigeria still operate with:

- Paper-based records  
- Unsecured or foreign-hosted digital platforms  
- No DNS-verified identity  
- Slow patient processing  
- No intelligent triage system  

This results in:

- Data vulnerability  
- Lack of sovereignty and compliance  
- Reduced efficiency  
- Long queues and delayed medical response  

There is a need for a **locally hosted, intelligent, and secure student health system built on the Nigerian DNS ecosystem (.ng)**.

# 📌 2. Solution Overview — SmartMed NG

SmartMed NG provides:

### ✔ **A functional, modern React-based student health portal**  
Built and deployed on Vercel, providing clean interfaces for student interactions.

### ✔ **AI-powered triage assistant (Flask ML API)**  
Identifies whether symptoms may be:  
- Mild  
- Moderate  
- Severe  
- Emergency  

Uses a lightweight transformer model (DistilBERT-base).

### ✔ **Fully NiRA-compliant domain integration**  
We purchased **smartmed.ng**, serving as our central registry.
